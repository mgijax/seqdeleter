The data files in this directory were contrived to test the seqdeleter

gbdel.txt.gz - contains 4 records designed to test the genbank deleter 
Seqid		Status in Database	Status after deleter run
_____________________________________________________________
AB000096	ACTIVE			DELETED
V00843		SPLIT			unchanged
M15131		DELETED			unchanged

release9.removed-records - contains four records to test refseq deleter
Seqid           Status in Database      Status after deleter run
_____________________________________________________________
NP_666882        ACTIVE                  DELETED
XP_359230        SPLIT                   unchanged

NM_000023        Not Loaded              DELETED

To use these test files you must first update each seqid with
a seqid that has the proper status in the database. M15131 and
XP_358168 were articially changed to status 'DELETED' for testing
purposes. The other's may change their status over time.
